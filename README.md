# single-stage-opamp-design-using-gpdk180-in-cadence
This repository contains a simple approach to designing a single-stage operational amplifier using gpdk180 in Cadence Virtuoso.

Here's a simple example problem of design:

Design a one-stage Op-Amp that satisfies the following specifications:

| Specification       | Requirement       |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Power Dissipation   | ≤ 800uW           |
| Gain                | ≥ 30 ± 10%        |
| C Load              | = 5pF             |
| Bandwidth           | ≥ 2MHz            |
| Vout (DC)           | = 2Vdd/3          |

Here is the topology of Single Stage Op-Amp with NMOS drivers and PMOS current mirror load

Now, Let us proceed with Mathematical Calculations:
Here, Vdd = 1.8V
Hence, Vout (DC) = 2 Vdd/3 = 1.2V

**SIZING M1 & M2 TRANSISTOR (NMOS)**
- Open cadence virtuoso > Click on File > Create New Library > Attach gpdk180 Technology File to it
- Then, Click on file > create Cell view (under that library) > Create Schematic
- Then, use Components to make a setup like given below in the picture for sizing the M1 and M2 transistors.

- Now, click on the check and save option and verify in the log that the schematic is saved with no errors
- Then, open ADE L for performing the width sweep
- perform DC sweep on the width variable wn and plot ID of the transistor

Then, from the above obtained graph, for Id = 170uA (calculated earlier) width of NMOS transistors M1 and M2 comes out to be 12.4u

**SIZING M3 & M4 TRANSISTOR (PMOS)**
- Click on file > create Cell view (under that library) > Create Schematic
- Then, use Components to make a setup like given below in the picture for sizing the M3 and M4 transistors.

- Now, click on the check and save option and verify in the log that the schematic is saved with no errors
- Then, open ADE L for performing the width sweep
- perform DC sweep on the width variable wn and plot "IS" of the transistor
